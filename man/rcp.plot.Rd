\title{
Function to plot the reciprocal lattice of a 2D crystal.
}
\description{
Plot the reciprocal lattice and assosiated diffraction circles for a bigrating.
}
\usage{
rcp.plot(a,b,k0,alpha)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{a}{Period in x direction
}
  \item{b}{Period in v direction
}
  \item{k0}{in-plane wavevector of a grazing photon (for light circles and SPP plot)
}
  \item{alpha}{Angle between x and v in real space (degrees)
}
